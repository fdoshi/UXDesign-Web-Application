UX Design Process:-
	UX designers follow basic steps to develop fully functional and aesthetically pleasing websites. These steps, when put together, are called Design Process. Different designers have their own standards of completing the job. However, common steps in designing website are 
•	Information gathering
•	Research and Analysis
•	Wireframes
•	Guerilla Testing
•	Prototype
•	Usability Testing
Website design changes as one goes through steps of design processing. For the Taniti island website, I had started the process with gathering details about the island. First step to plan for a website is to think of all prospect viewers of the website. For this designer need to have better understanding on users of the website, the reason for visiting website, and kind of information users will be looking for on website. Once designer has clear idea on this information, he or she can work on storyboard, color theme, and template design accordingly. 

Creating Wireframe:-
	Wireframe is also known as page schematic or screen blueprint. It is a visual representation of structure of a webpage. Wireframe should show arrangement of webpage elements in orderly fashion. 
	While designing wireframes for Taniti island website, I choose to use similar template for all pages of the site. All web pages of the website have consistent header and footer for all pages. Wireframes, when ready, are put under guerilla testing.




Guerilla Testing:-
	Guerilla testing is a means of capturing user feedback on design. I have done guerilla testing on wireframe with three different users. 

Testing Reviews:-
Users reaction on design was quite positive. All users liked the arrangement of all elements. One user wanted to see video or photo slides in place of an image on homepage. In his view, video would be more engaging and can tell grater story than image. Another user wanted to see a tab of the current page in menu bar with different style than other tabs. This design change helps user know which page is in view. Third user noticed that there is no information available on stores/shopping anywhere on the website. This is very useful information, and many viewers want to know location and hours of local grocery/convenience store. 

Actionable Feedbacks:-
	In general, users liked the simple design and easy navigation of the webpage. User reviews are very useful to improve quality of the contents. I have made few changes in web design based on users’ comment. I added local stores list with location information in Food and Drink page. I have set a color code on menu bar tabs which distinguish current page tab from other tab. I really liked the idea of setting up gif image on home page. After self-reviewing my design and prototype, I am considering including weather forecast panel on side bars of pages. 

Conclusion:-
Users feedback on the Taniti island website helped a lot in improving its usability, functionality, and aesthetic look. Users liked the choice of photos. I have taken photos from google photo gallery and some of the text is from Lorem Ipsum. Bottom line is I could add more elements to the website for better look but all the feedback I received shows the website passed the usability test and it is largely acceptable by viewers.
